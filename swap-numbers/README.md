# Programming Projects for Beginners

This is a collection of beginner-friendly programming projects designed to help you practice and improve your coding skills. Each project includes a detailed problem statement, test cases, step-by-step algorithm, implementation, and key concepts.

## Swap Two Numbers

Swap values of two variables using a third variable.

### Problem Statement

Write a program to swap the values of two variables using a third variable. The program should take two numbers as input and output the swapped values.

### Test Cases

| Case                         | Expected Output |
| ---------------------------- | --------------- |
| [#1](./test-cases/case1.txt) | a = 10, b = 5   |
| [#2](./test-cases/case2.txt) | a = 3, b = -7   |

### Step-by-Step Algorithm

Here is a step-by-step algorithm for writing the program:

- Using Natural Language

  ```plaintext
  1. Start the program.

  2. Declare variables:
     - Create two variables: `a`, and `b` to store the input numbers.
     - Create a variable `temp` which will be used for swapping.

  3. Take user input:
     - Prompt the user to enter the first number and store it in `a`.
     - Prompt the user to enter the second number and store it in `b`.

  4. Display the original values:
     - Print the values of `a` and `b` before swapping.

  5. Swap the values:
     - Assign the value of `a` to `temp`.
     - Assign the value of `b` to `a`.
     - Assign the value of `temp` to `b`.

  6. Display the swapped values:
     - Print the values of `a` and `b` after swapping.

  7. End the program.
  ```

### Implementation
